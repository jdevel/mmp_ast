CDR:
Dump the contents of the SQL/cdr.sql into it's own database.
Preferably asterisk_cdr since the config file is already set for that.

REAL TIME ASTERISK:
Create a database called asterisk_rt and dump the contents of the asterisk_rt.sql into that database.

CONF FILES:
I recommend doing cp -Rp /etc/asterisk /etc/asterisk_date_here
before copying these files into place.
Edit the conf files and add the proper database parameters and then
copy them to /etc/asterisk.
Restart asterisk. Done.
