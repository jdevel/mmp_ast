BEFORE YOU INSTALL:
Notes, All of this is based on Ubuntu server 8.04 LTS.

CDR:
Dump the contents of the SQL/cdr.sql into it's own database.
Preferably asterisk_cdr since the config file is already set for that.

REAL TIME ASTERISK:
Create a database called asterisk_rt and dump the contents of the asterisk_rt.sql into that database.

CONF FILES:
I recommend doing cp -Rp /etc/asterisk /etc/asterisk_date_here
before copying these files into place.
Edit the conf files and add the proper database parameters and then
copy them to /etc/asterisk.
Restart asterisk. Done.

NOTES:
conf + asterisk_confs directories hold configs neccessary
for both Asterisk and Asterisk realtime with mysql.

DEPLOY vs DEPLOY2:
deploy.sh is for a barebones vicidial setup.
deploy2.sh is for Asterisk realtime so asterisk is MySQL database managable
instead of file based.
deploy2 also prepares for JAACT.

INSTALL:
1. ubuntu-build.sh
2. deploy or deploy2.sh
3. vici_perl.sh
4. Install Asterisk + addons + dahdi-linux + dahdi-tools + libpri (in this order)
5. Create MySQL tables.
6. copy php.ini to web location.
7. Install astguiclient.
8. copy astgui_initd to /etc/init.d and check 'runlevel'
   Then do 'ln -s /etc/init.d/astgui_initd /etc/rc(x).d/S99_astgui_initd'
9. copy crontab-stuff.txt into root crontab
10. Configure Asterisk for sip provider.
11. Enjoy!
